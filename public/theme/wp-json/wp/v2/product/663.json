Coffee cups are typically made of glazed ceramic, and have a single handle for portability while the beverage is hot. Ceramic construction allows a beverage to be drunk while hot, providing insulation to the beverage, and quickly washed with cold water without fear of breakage, compared to typical glassware.<\/p>\n<p>A coffee cup may also be a disposable cup in which hot beverages, including coffee, can be contained. Disposable coffee cups may be made out of paper or polystyrene foam. At coffee shops, paper cups are commonly used to give beverages to customers on the go, usually with a coffee cup sleeve to provide insulation against heat transferred through the container. A new alternative trend sees consumers purchasing reusable coffee cups instead of disposable cups as a more sustainable approach to coffee consumption becomes more popular. These can include bamboo cups, americano cups made from polypropylene as well as other organic materials such as starch and paper pulp.

Compacted oxide layer glaze describes the often shiny, wear-protective layer of oxide formed when two metals (or a metal and ceramic) are slid against each other at high temperature in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. The layer forms on either or both of the surfaces in contact and can protect against wear.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor dunt ut labore et dolore aliqua.
